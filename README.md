# tas2781-fix-16IRX8H
A script to fix the audio problems on Legion Pro 7 16IRX8H on Linux.
This is a combination of solutions from [this thread](https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Ubuntu/Ubuntu-and-legion-pro-7-16IRX8H-audio-issues/m-p/5210709), with an automatic installer to eliminate manual steps.

## Features

- Apply a fix to the TAS2781 chip when pipewire is activated
- Apply the fix when awaking from suspend

Tested on Ubuntu 24, kernel 6.8.0-53-generic , CPU AMD Ryzen 9 7945HX with Radeon , HOST Legion Pro 7 16ARX8H

## Installation

### Dependencies
[jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) and [i2c-tools](https://archive.kernel.org/oldwiki/i2c.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/I2C_Tools.html) must be installed before applying the fix. Both are supported by mainstream package managers.

### Install

To install, simply run the following command:

```bash

git clone  https://github.com/DemonChocolatine/tas2781.git
cd tas2781
./tas2781-fix.sh --install

```

Then make sure to **reboot your system.**

---

### Uninstall

To uninstall, run:

```bash
/usr/local/bin/tas2781-fix --uninstall
```

## Usage

### Re-trigger the fix

To re-trigger the fix, restart the service:

```bash
systemctl --user restart tas2781-fix.service
```
### Check the status of the fix

To check if the fix was applied, run:

```bash
systemctl status tas2781-fix.service
```

Note that this is the status of the system-level service, which actually executes the fix.

You should see something like this:

<pre>
<span style="color: #00ff00">‚óè</span> tas2781-fix.service - Run the tas2781-fix script when triggered
     Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/tas2781-fix.service; static)
     Active: <span style="color: #00ff00">active (exited)</span> since Sat 2024-11-09 12:30:55 CST; 10min ago

   Main PID: 9632 (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
   Mem peak: 3.6M

</pre>

This indicates that the fix ran and exited successfully.
